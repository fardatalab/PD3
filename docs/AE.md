# Artifact Evaluation

## Getting Started
In order to make Artifact Evaluation easier in the presence of specialized hardware, we have provisioned an experiment testbed for AE access. The details on accessing the hardware can be found in the Artifact Description on HotCRP. In order to circumvent any dependency related issues, the hardware testbed provides the set-up software application, a new build is *not required*.

A good basic test of the artifacts would be to run the 1-thread version of Fig 11 for all Sync RDMA, LEAP, Redy and PD3. 

## Detailed Instructions

The `exp/` folder contains scripts and descriptions to reproduce PD3 figures. 
It is advised to run the experiments in the following order (note that some figures that are not central to the main claims of PD3 are left out):
- Fig 11
- Fig 12
- Fig 15
- Fig 16
- Fig 14
- Fig 18
- Fig 21a
- Fig 21c
- Fig 13
- Fig 17
