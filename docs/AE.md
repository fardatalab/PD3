# Artifact Evaluation

## Getting Started
In order to make Artifact Evaluation easier in the presence of specialized hardware, we have provisioned an experiment testbed for AE access. The details on accessing the hardware can be found in the Artifact Description on the submission platform. In order to circumvent any dependency related issues, the hardware testbed provides the set-up software application.

A good basic test of the artifacts would be to run the 1-thread version of Fig 11 for all Sync RDMA, LEAP, Redy and PD3. 

## Detailed Instructions

The `exp/` folder contains scripts and descriptions to reproduce PD3 figures.
